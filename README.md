---

## Description

This existing marketing page had many errors that needed to be corrected.  Some didn't meet **accessibility standards** as they didn't contain any image alt attributes.


### Corrections applied:

* **Semantic** HTML elements were added to apply a logical structure to source code
  * For example, several *non-semantic elements* such as (div) were replaced by semantic elements to better define specific sections of the website
* A descriptive title was added as **Marketing Agency** to relate with the content
  * This makes it more likely to appear under *search engine optimization* (SEO) results
* Cleaned up HTML code so it's easier to read by ridding of unecessary spacing
  * Some headings and one navigation link were also corrected
* To meet **accessibility standards**:
  * Alt attributes were added to all image elements
  * Tested navigation with tabbing to ensure that it followed a sequential order
