## Description

This page had many errors that needed to be corrected and didn't meet accessibility standards.

## Corrections

Semantic HTML elements were added to apply a logical structure.  For example, several non-semantic elements such as <div> were replaced by semantic elements to better define that section of the website.  Added an appropriate title to relate with the content, so it's more likely to appear under search results (SEO).  Also, cleaned up HTML code so it's easier to read by ridding of unecessary spaces and lines and corrected some headings.  Finally, ensured tabbing navigation to ensure that it followed a sequential order.

In order to meet accessibility standards, Alt attributes were added to image elements.  Ensured that tabbing worked in sequential order and corrected first link to allow it to work properly.
